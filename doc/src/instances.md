# Instances

The project comes with a set of predefined jobshop instances that you will use for the project.
All instances are provided in the `instances/` folder of the repository.


## Test instances


Test instances start with the `aaa` prefix. 
We provide three of them

 - `aaa1`: a very small instance that you can use to get acquainted with the different encodings
 - `aaa2`: a slightly more complex instance that has been used during the classes
 - `aaa3`: an instance that produces deterministic results for the greedy methods


## Benchmark instances

All other instances are common benchmarks that you can use to test the performance of your algorithms.

You can find more informations (lower and upper bounds, best known solutions, ...) on the website [http://jobshop.jjvh.nl/index.php](http://jobshop.jjvh.nl/index.php).
